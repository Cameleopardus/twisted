<h1>The Twisted Zope Interfaces FAQ</h1>

<h2>Twisted components system in 2.0</h2>

<p>Twisted code's own use of the <code
class="API">twisted.python.components</code> package has been updated to use <a
href="http://www.zope.org/Wikis/Interfaces/FrontPage">Zope Interfaces</a> in
the 2.0 release.</p>

<p>New code developed starting with the 2.0 release of Twisted Core should use Zope
Interfaces directly rather than using the twisted.python.components
package.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
 
<h3>Why did Twisted switch to Zope Interfaces?</h3>

<p>
The twisted.python.components package is a large amount of on-going
maintenance. Using the Zope Interface package also provides a greater level of
compatibility between Twisted interfaces and Zope interfaces.
</p>

<h3>Why did Twisted switch to Zope Interfaces rather than PyProtocols?</h3>

<p>
The Zope Interface package was chosen over PyProtocols because of its greater
conceptual similarity to twisted.python.components.
</p>

<h3>Will this affect my deployment?</h3>

<p>
No. Releases of Twisted Core will include Zope Interfaces.
</p>

<h3>How can I update my own code?</h3>

<p>
Classes written using twisted.python.components declare which interfaces they
implement in this style:
</p>

<code>
class C:
    __implements__ = IFoo,
</code>

<p>
This should be changed to:
</p>

<code>
class C:
    zope.interface.implements(IFoo)
</code>
