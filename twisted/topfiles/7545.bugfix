Legacy logging now adds a traceback to rendered events to match existing behavior; this was a regression since merging the new logging (as yet unreleased).
Legacy logging now emits at `LogLevel.critical` if `isError` is set (ie. capturing an unhandled exception) to match new logging.
Python stdlib logging logs at `CRITICAL` level if `isError` is set (was `ERROR`).
